# AI_hw1_Tic_Tac_Toe

Homework description:
Implement the minimax algorithm with alfa-beta pruning on a simple tic-tac-toe game. Create a graphical user interface and enable the user to choose the difficulty by setting the depth of the minimax game tree (e.g. number of moves to think ahead).

This project creates a tic tac toe board by using System.Drawing class.
If the difficulty level is not selected, the AI is not activated. The difficulty level can be selected between 2 and 8.
When it is selected, one turn player starts and the other turn computer starts.
